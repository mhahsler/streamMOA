\title{D-Stream Data Stream Clustering Algorithm}
\usage{
DSC_DStream_MOA(decayFactor = 0.998, Cm = 3, Cl = 0.8, Beta = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{decayFactor}{The decay factor}

\item{Cm}{Controls the threshold for dense grids}

\item{Cl}{Controls the threshold for sparse grids}

\item{Beta}{Adjusts the window of protection for renaming previously deleted
grids as sporadic}
}
\description{
This is an interface to the MOA implementation of D-Stream. A C++
implementation (including reclustering with attraction) is available as
\code{\link[stream]{DSC_DStream}}.
}
\details{
D-Stream creates an equally spaced grid and estimates the density in each
grid cell using the count of points falling in the cells. Grid cells are
classified based on density into dense, transitional and sporadic cells. The
density is faded after every new point by a decay factor.

\bold{Note:} The MOA implementation of D-Stream currently does not return
micro clusters.

\examples{

# data with 2 clusters in 2 dimensions
stream = DSD_Gaussians(2,2, mu = rbind(c(-10,-10), c(10,10)))

# cluster with D-Stream
dstream <- DSC_DStream_MOA(decayFactor=0.998)
update(dstream, stream, 10000)
dstream

# plot macro-clusters
plot(dstream, stream, type= "macro")
