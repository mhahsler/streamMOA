#' D-Stream Data Stream Clustering Algorithm
#'
#' This is an interface to the MOA implementation of D-Stream. A C++
#' implementation (including reclustering with attraction) is available as
#' \code{\link[stream]{DSC_DStream}}.
#'
#' D-Stream creates an equally spaced grid and estimates the density in each
#' grid cell using the count of points falling in the cells. Grid cells are
#' classified based on density into dense, transitional and sporadic cells. The
#' density is faded after every new point by a decay factor.
#'
#' \bold{Note:} The MOA implementation of D-Stream currently does not return
#' micro clusters.
#'
#' @param decayFactor The decay factor
#' @param Cm Controls the threshold for dense grids
#' @param Cl Controls the threshold for sparse grids
#' @param Beta Adjusts the window of protection for renaming previously deleted
#' grids as sporadic
